### `rules`
-  A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
- There's a free slot (always on) in the middle
-  You can have multiple bingos
-  Build a fully working Bingo App using ReactJS **respecting the 3 basic rules explained above**.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `task`
- [x]  The game **must** always fit nicely to any screen-size (e.g. mobile).
- [x]  **Design your own version** – our game is an example. Be creative and pick your own design!
- [x]  Having a bingo requires some **nice visual reward**. You don't need to use confetti – choose something you believe fits best.
- [x]  Think of multiple gamers playing the Bingo together.. ensure that winning the game is possible and fair. (hint: if every player has the same card, everybody would win)
- [x]  **Add something new.** Come up with something you would enjoy while playing the game.

## TO-DO
- [ ] implement test cases
